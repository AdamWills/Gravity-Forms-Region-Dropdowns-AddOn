# Gravity-Forms-Address-Dropdowns-AddOn
Create state and provice dropdowns for International addresses in Gravity Forms.

This plugin does not replace the free-form text field that Gravity Forms uses for International addresses.
Instead it populates the existing free text field with the value from the state or provice dropdown. It will hide
the free text field when the current country is US or Canada, and display it for other countries.
